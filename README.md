# Foodstamp Scratch Ticket

Produced as a live demo for my Bachelors of Design, Industrial Design final show. The demo was presented on a Microsoft Surface device, as a means to allow users to interact with the project, a scratch lottery ticket to facilitate users finding out if they were eligible for federal SNAP (food stamp) benefits. This particular repo represents an attempt at rebuilding the tool for my web based portfolio. It was apparently aborted, as at the time I had very little dev experience.

I'll have to revisit it now.
